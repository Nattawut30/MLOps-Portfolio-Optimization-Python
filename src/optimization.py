"""
Builds portfolio weights two ways: max-Sharpe (Markowitz) and risk parity.

Max-Sharpe needs one expected-return number per asset. It defaults to the
black_litterman column rather than historical_mean, since the previous
step's own output showed historical mean swinging wildly with only ~100
days of history, while Black-Litterman stayed anchored and stable.
historical_mean remains available as an explicit override.

Both optimizers are long-only (weights bounded 0 to 1) — a disclosed
simplification, not the only valid choice.
