My Portfolio optimization pipeline covering Black-Litterman and risk parity allocation, Brownian motion and Heston stochastic volatility simulation, and FFT tail risk hedge pricing. Built as an MLOps project: a scheduled batch pipeline computes and versions every result on a Streamlit dashboard displays the latest output.

***System Architecture***
-

The pipeline runs in two separate stages.

A scheduled batch job (GitHub Actions), run monthly on the 1st, extracts prices, computes returns
and covariance, estimates expected returns, optimizes portfolio weights,
simulates risk, and prices a tail risk hedge. Results are published to
the repository's "latest" GitHub Release rather than committed to git.
Each run overwrites the same release assets in place, so repo size and
commit count stay constant no matter how often the pipeline runs. The
pipeline's own keep-alive signal is pushed to a separate branch, never
to main, which stays fully protected and human-only.

A Streamlit dashboard fetches only the finished output of that job. It
never recomputes anything and never touches the data source directly.

Data moves through three layers on disk. (Bronze -> Silver -> Gold)

Design decisions:

- The data source sits behind a single interface. The original source
  was replaced during development after it started blocking scripted
  requests. Swapping providers again touches one file, not the pipeline.
- Portfolio construction and risk simulation each have two interchangeable
  implementations behind a shared interface: max-Sharpe and risk parity
  for optimization, geometric Brownian motion and Heston for simulation.
- The dashboard never imports the compute modules directly. It reads only
  the parquet files those modules produce.

***Returns and covariance***
-

$$r_t = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}\\right)$$

Log returns, used in place of price levels since they are close to stationary.

$$\\hat{\\Sigma} = (1 - \\alpha)S + \\alpha F$$

Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage covariance. S is the sample covariance, F is the
shrinkage target, alpha is estimated from the data.

***Expected returns***
-

$$\\pi = \\delta \\Sigma w_{mkt}$$

Black-Litterman equilibrium return. With no investor views, this is the
model's output directly.

$$E[R] = \\left[(\\tau\\Sigma)^{-1} + P^T\\Omega^{-1}P\\right]^{-1}\\left[(\\tau\\Sigma)^{-1}\\pi + P^T\\Omega^{-1}Q\\right]$$

Black-Litterman posterior return, blending the equilibrium with investor
views P, Q, and view uncertainty Omega.

***Portfolio construction***
-

$$\\max_{w} \\frac{w^T\\mu - r_f}{\\sqrt{w^T\\Sigma w}} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\sum_i w_i = 1,\\ w_i \\geq 0$$

Max-Sharpe, long only, solved with SLSQP.

$$w_i(\\Sigma w)_i = w_j(\\Sigma w)_j \\quad \\forall\\, i, j$$

Risk parity. Every asset contributes equally to total portfolio variance.

***Simulation***
-

$$dS_t = \\mu S_t\\,dt + \\sigma S_t\\,dW_t$$

Geometric Brownian motion, constant volatility.

$$dS_t = \\mu S_t\\,dt + \\sqrt{v_t}\\,S_t\\,dW_t^S \\qquad dv_t = \\kappa(\\theta - v_t)\\,dt + \\xi\\sqrt{v_t}\\,dW_t^v \\qquad dW_t^S dW_t^v = \\rho\\,dt$$

Heston stochastic volatility, simulated with a full truncation Euler
scheme so variance cannot go negative.

$$\\text{VaR}_\\alpha = \\inf\\{l : P(L > l) \\leq 1-\\alpha\\} \\qquad \\text{CVaR}_\\alpha = E[L \\mid L \\geq \\text{VaR}_\\alpha]$$

***Hedge pricing***
-

$$C(K) = \\frac{e^{-\\alpha k}}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-ivk}\\,\\psi(v)\\,dv$$

Heston option price via the Carr-Madan FFT method, using the model's
characteristic function. Priced against two independent methods, FFT and
Monte Carlo, cross-checked against each other on every run.

$$P = C - S_0 + Ke^{-rT}$$

Put-call parity, converting the FFT call price into a put price.
